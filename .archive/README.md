# Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy code that has been superseded by the current pipeline implementation. Files are preserved here for reference and historical context.

## Contents

| Subdirectory | Original Location | Description |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `scattering/` | `scattering/legacy/` | Early burst-specific notebooks (Casey, Freya, Wilhelm) |
| `scattering_pipeline/` | `scattering/scat_analysis/legacy/` | Previous pipeline versions (v0, v1) |
| `scintillation/` | `scintillation/legacy/` | Per-burst scintillation notebooks and old module versions |
| `simulation/` | `simulation/old_scripts/` | Simulator development iterations (v0-v10) |

## Note

These files are kept for:
- Extracting best-fit parameters from historical analyses
- Understanding design evolution
- Debugging regressions

For current analyses, use the unified notebooks:
- `scattering/notebooks/scattering_analysis.ipynb`
- `scintillation/notebooks/scintillation_analysis.ipynb`
