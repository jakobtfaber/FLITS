# FLITS Documentation

Welcome to the **FLITS** (Fitting Likelihoods In Time-Frequency Spectra) documentation hub.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- [**Installation**](getting-started/installation.md): Set up your environment (fix Conda SSL issues, install dependencies).
- [**Quick Start**](getting-started/quickstart.md): Run your first scattering analysis in one line.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- [**Overview**](architecture/overview.md): High-level data flow, directory layout, and module responsibilities.
- [**Inventory**](architecture/inventory.md): A comprehensive catalog of all analysis pipelines (Scattering, Scintillation), simulations, and utility scripts in this repository.

## 🛠️ Workflows

- **Scattering Analysis**: See `scattering/scat_analysis/README.md` (if available) or refer to the [Quick Start](getting-started/quickstart.md).
- **Scintillation Analysis**: See `scintillation/scint_analysis/`.
- **Simulation**: See `simulation/`.

## 👩‍💻 Development

- See [Architecture Inventory](architecture/inventory.md) for the status of current components.
